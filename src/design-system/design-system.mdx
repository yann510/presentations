# What is a design system?

---

<TextBlock margin={10}>

## A design system is a collection of reusable components, guided by clear standards, that can be assembled together to build any number of applications.

<TextBlock margin={10}>

## Why would I spend time developing a design system?

<ul>
  <Steps>
    <li>Consistent branding in every section of the website</li>
    <li>Designer and developer communication is improved</li>
    <li>Code re-usability is greatly enhanced by using consistent developing patterns</li>
    <li>Development time of frontend tasks are greatly reduced as components behaviours are predictable</li>
  </Steps>
</ul>

# Let's talk numbers

<ul>
  <Steps>
    <li>We have ~30 developers</li>
    <li>Out of those 30, <Bold>~20 will work on frontend code</Bold></li>
    <li>Those 20 developers will work ~50% of the time on frontend code, so that's <Bold>10 full-time developers</Bold></li>
    <li>Let's assume the average salary is 80k, which is <Bold>800k yearly</Bold></li>
    <li>We would need <Bold>~20 components</Bold> to reach the aforementioned <Bold>25% speed increase</Bold></li>
    <li>Developing a component takes <Bold>~5 days</Bold></li>
    <li>Developing those components will take <Bold>~100 days and cost ~22k</Bold></li>
    <li>After this initial investment, we would enjoy a <Bold>~25% speed increase</Bold> for development time, which equals to <Bold>200k yearly in extra features produced</Bold></li>
    <li>The more developers we have, <Bold>the higher the rewards are</Bold></li>
  </Steps>
</ul>

# This is just the beginning

<ul>
  <Steps>
    <li>We can then build on top of that and provide examples of our best practices of common recipes.</li>
    <li>Eg: how do you build a form, how do you build a modal, how do you build tabs, etc</li>
    <li>Those would not only showcase best practices, but would serve as an amazing source for documentation</li>
    <li>This would also reduce the number of recipes we have for the same pattern and thus make the code easier to read wherever you are</li>
  </Steps>
</ul>
