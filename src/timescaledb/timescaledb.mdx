# Time Series Database (TSDB)

---

## What is a time series database?

<TextBlock>
  <ul>
    <Steps>
      <li>It's a database optimized for time-stamped data</li>
      <li>
        This could be server metrics, application performance monitoring, network data, sensor data and many other types
        of data
      </li>
    </Steps>
  </ul>
</TextBlock>

---

## What's the difference with other databases?

<TextBlock>
  <ul>
    <Steps>
      <li>
        They perform time-stamp data storage which allows them to handle compression and data lifecycle management
        efficiently
      </li>
      <li>
        They can handle large time series scans of many records spanning many months and respond in milliseconds instead
        of seconds
      </li>
      <li>
        They can perform automatic aggregation on old data so it takes less space as precise data might become less
        relevant after a while
      </li>
    </Steps>
  </ul>
</TextBlock>

## TimescaleDB

<TextBlock>
  <ul>
    <Steps>
      <li>
        It is a database that leverages Postgres and act as a plugin to support time series data within this environment
      </li>
      <li>
        Some notable commands that are super useful for time series include `time_bucket()`, `time_bucket_gapfill()`,
        `histogram()`
      </li>
    </Steps>
  </ul>
</TextBlock>

## time_bucket()

This function will group data based on an interval

The first parameter is the interval, the second is the timestamp

<CodeBlock
  language="sql"
  codeString={`
SELECT time_bucket('5 minutes', time) AS five_min ...
`}
/>

---

import timeBucketImage from "./timescaledb-time-bucket.jpg";

## time_bucket() visualisation

---

## time_bucket_gapfill()

<TextBlock>
This function will group data based on an interval and also fill the gap between the specified range.

The first parameter is the interval, the second is the timestamp and then you specify which range you want filled in
the where clause

  <CodeBlock
    language="sql"
    codeString={`
SELECT time_bucket('5 minutes', time) AS five_min ... WHERE time > now() - INTERVAL '5 months' AND time < now()
`}
  />
</TextBlock>

---

## histogram()

<TextBlock>
  This function will create buckets between a specified range for a given value.
  Each bucket will contain the count of elements for the given value range of the bucket.

The first parameter is the metric which you want to bucket, the second is minimum value of the bucket,
the third is the maximum value of the bucket and the last one is the number of buckets to create.

  <CodeBlock
    language="sql"
    codeString={`
    SELECT device_id, histogram(battery_level, 20, 60, 5)
`}
  />
</TextBlock>
